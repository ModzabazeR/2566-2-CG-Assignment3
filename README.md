# 2566-2-CG-Assignment3
This project is for my Computer Graphics class at KMITL. The goal of this project is to create a 3D scene using OpenGL and C++.
- Use vertices to create a 800 x 600 image
- Work in pairs
- Draw image in a theme of “MY PRECIOUS MOMENT”
- Use Modern OpenGL with lighting model. You can use the external model and textures.

## Features

- Load and view 3D models in the OBJ format
- Move the camera around the scene using keyboard and mouse
- Incremental model loading to avoid freezing
- Basic lighting

## Dependencies

- C++
- OpenGL
- GLFW
- GLEW
- GLM
- stb_image

## Building the Project

1. Ensure you have a C++ compiler and all the dependencies installed.
2. Clone the repository.
3. Build the project using your preferred C++ compiler or IDE.

## Usage

Run the compiled executable to start the program. The camera can be moved using the W, A, S, D keys and the mouse.
